            Separamadu Lasith Malinga (Sinhala: සෙපරමාදු ලසිත් මාලිංග; born 28 August 1983) is a Sri Lankan cricketer. He captained
            the Sri Lankan 2014 T20 World Cup winning side. Widely regarded as one of the best limited over bowlers of all time, he
            is the only bowler to have taken 4 wickets in 4 consecutive balls (double hat-trick) in international cricket two times,
            against South Africa in 2007 and New Zeland 2019. He is a right-arm fast bowler that is commonly used as a specialist
            death bowler, and is well known for his distinctive round-arm action, sometimes referred to as a sling action, which
            leads to his nickname "Slinga Malinga".
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most successful limited-overs bowlers of all time, Malinga's unorthodox action and dipping slower ball
            yorkers are credited with much of his success He is best known for his ability to take consecutive wickets, with
            in-swinging yorkers: he is the only bowler in the world to have two World Cup hat-tricks the only bowler to have
            taken three hat-tricks in ODIs and one of only two players to have taken four wickets in four consecutive balls in any
            form of international cricket, which he alone has done twice He is also the first bowler to take five
            hat-tricks across all formats of international cricket, and holds the record for most hat-tricks in international
            cricket
        </p>

            Twenty20 International cricket. Malinga took a hat-trick to become the first bowler to claim two T20I hat-tricks,
            and four wickets in four balls, in the third over of his spell, while becoming the second bowler in the world to take
            four wickets in four consecutive balls in T20I history after Rashid Khan during the process.

    <h3 id="life">Early Life</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Malinga grew up in modest circumstances in Rathgama, a coastal village situated 12 km northwest of Galle. He often
            played cricket with friends on the sand banks and coconut groves by a river in his cricket-obsessed village. His father
            Separamadu Milton, is a retired bus mechanic who worked out of the Galle depot. He had his education at three
            schools, namely Mahinda College, Galle, Vidyaloka College, Galle and Vidyathilake Vidyalaya, Thiranagama. Malinga
            had his primary education at Vidyathilake Vidyalaya in Thiranagama, a school situated near by his village. He married
            Tanya Perera in 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
            After passing the grade 5 Scholarship Examination in 1993, he entered Vidyaloka College, Galle for his secondary
            education, where he started his cricket career. Here Malinga was discovered by former Sri Lankan paceman Champaka
            Ramanayake. Champaka, so impressed by Malinga's raw ability, invited him to join the Galle Cricket Club. Champaka
            also helped him to join the first XI cricket team of Mahinda College, Galle. Joining Mahinda College was the turning
            point of his cricket career and he was helped by some of its distinguished Old boys. A short-lived attempt to make
            Malinga's action more upright led to much reduced pace and failing accuracy. Malinga promptly returned to his natural
            action with success, and with great encouragement from Ramanayake.
