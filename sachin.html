            Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international cricketer who served as captain of the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest
            batsmen in the history of cricket. He is the highest run scorer of all time in international cricket, and the only
            player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day
            International (ODI), the holder of the record for the most runs in both Test and ODI cricket, and the only player to
            complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an
            all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. He is affectionately known as "Little Master" or "Master Blaster".

            Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at
            the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four
            years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of
            all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards. Later in his
            career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances
            for India. He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in
            South Africa.

    <h3 id="life">Early Life</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973 to a Maharashtrian
            family. His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in
            the insurance industry. Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has
            three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his
            first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.
        </p>  
        <p>
            Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy,
            Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school. He also showed an
            interest in tennis, idolising John McEnroe. To help curb his mischievous and bullying tendencies, Ajit introduced
            the young Sachin to cricket in 1984. He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer
            of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the young Sachin did not play his best. Ajit told Achrekar that
            he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested
            the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently
            unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir
            (English) High School, a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers.
            Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East). He was
            also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings. Tendulkar would practice
            for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and
            the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed,
            the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized
            possessions.He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic
            schedule.
