            <div>
                The Mumbai Indians are a franchise cricket team based in Mumbai, Maharashtra, that competes in the Indian Premier League. Founded in 2008, the team is owned by India's biggest conglomerate, Reliance Industries, through its 100% subsidiary IndiaWin Sports. Since its establishment, the team has played its home matches in the 33,108-capacity Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. In 2017, the Mumbai Indians became the first franchise to cross the $100 million mark in brand value among the IPL franchises. The brand value of Mumbai Indians, in 2019, is estimated to be around â‚¹809 crore (roughly $115 million), the highest among all the IPL franchises for the fourth consecutive year. Chennai Super Kings by 22 runs. The Mumbai team management was criticised for the "strategic errors" during the final such as sending Abhishek Nayar and Harbhajan at batting positions 3 and 4 respectively while Duminy and Pollard were sent at 7 and 8. Mumbai skipper, who scored 618 runs at an average of 47.53 and strike rate of 132.6, won the Orange Cap for scoring most runs in the season. Mumbai qualified for the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 where they were eliminated in the group stage with two wins and two defeats in four matches.

            <h2 id="intro">The Loss of 2010 </h1>
            <div>
                At the 2010 players auction, Mumbai Indians bought Trinidadian all-rounder for $750,000 following a secret tiebreaker. After the auction, they signed up ten uncapped Indian players out of whom seven were former ICL players. Former India cricketer Robin Singh was named as the head coach of the team as Pollock took up the  role of bowling coach. Mumbai had to shift their home venue to Brabourne Stadium for the season since the Wankhede was
                undergoing renovation to host some matches of the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. Mumbai won seven of their first
                eight games to take the top spot in the points table. Their success was mainly due to the efforts of Tendulkar, Malinga,
                Harbhajan, Ambati Rayudu and Saurabh Tiwary. They won three of the remaining six league games and finished with
                20 played at the Wankhede where Mumbai faced the Kolkata Knight Riders.
