            Kieron Adrian Pollard (born 12 May 1987) is a Trinidadian cricketer. He captains the West Indies cricket team in limited
            overs cricket. An aggressive all-rounder, Pollard is a medium-pace bowler and big-hitting batsman in the middle-order.
            After shining during the 2009 Champions League, he was signed by both the Southern Redbacks and Somerset for their
            domestic Twenty20 campaigns. He was the joint highest paid player in the 2010 Indian Premier League, playing for Mumbai
            Indians.
        </p>
        <p>   
            In September 2019, Pollard was named as the captain of the West Indies' One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20
            International (T20I) teams. In March 2020, Pollard became the first cricketer to play in 500 Twenty20 matches.
            While his game is suited for limited overs variety in which he has enjoyed a long international career, he has never
            played Test Cricket. In a match against Sri Lanka in March 2021, he hit six sixes in one over bowled by Akila
            Dananjaya and became the third batsman to do so in international cricket after Herschelle Gibbs and Yuvraj Singh
        </p>

    <h3 id="life">Early Life</h3>

        <p>
            Pollard was born in Tacarigua, Trinidad and Tobago, where he was raised, along with two younger sisters, in a poor home
            by his single mother. Speaking about it, Pollard reflects "It was pretty easy, it was ideal getting up and your mum say
            'We only have X of money'." After representing Trinidad and Tobago in the 2005 TCL Group West Indies Under-19
            Challenge, he was selected as part of the West Indies Under-19 cricket team to tour Pakistan. Pollard top-scored for the
            West Indies in the first youth One Day International (ODI), scoring 53 runs off 49 balls. Pollard made another
            half-century in the second match, but didn't manage to make double figures in either of last two games. He was named in
            the West Indies squad for the 2006 U/19 Cricket World Cup, held in Sri Lanka, where he only managed to make 19–runs in
            his four innings, though he did manage to take two wickets in a defeat to Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the 2006 English season he came to England to play for Haxey CC in Lincolnshire; he played five games for the
            club before he was recalled by Trinidad and Tobago to play in the Stanford Twenty20. Pollard made his senior debut
            for Trinidad and Tobago in the twenty20 competition against the Cayman Islands in July 2006. He finished the tournament
            with a respectable return of six wickets, and starred in the semi-final against Nevis, scoring 83 runs off just 38
            balls, an innings which included 7 sixes to book Trinidad and Tobago's place in the final. He made his first-class
            debut six months later against Barbados, and marked the occasion with a century. As in the Twenty20, his innings
            contained a large number of boundaries, with 86 of his 126 runs coming from either fours or sixes. A score of 46 not
            out on his List A debut ensured that Pollard was in the selector's minds for the upcoming World Cup, and he described it
            as "a dream come true" when he was selected in the provisional 30-man squad for the tournament. Pollard's "dream
            run" continued with half-centuries in both four-day and 50-over matches against Guyana, followed by his second
            first-class century, coming against the Leeward Islands. Against Jamaica, Pollard showed his bowling ability,
            claiming four wickets in his seven overs to claim his fifth man of the match award in his 15th senior match. Trinidad
            and Tobago remained unbeaten in the 2006–07 KFC Cup, beating Windward Islands in the final to claim the trophy. Pollard
            finished as the competition's leading run-scorer, making 261 runs from his seven innings at an average of over 40.
